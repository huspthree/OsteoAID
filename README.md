OsteoAID is a **YOLOv8-based detection network model** that has been trained on the largest known **multicentre X-ray dataset**, comprising **15,871 anteroposterior hip X-ray images** from **12,669 patients** with **ONFH** (Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head). Each image was annotated by expert orthopaedists according to the **Ficat-Arlet staging system**, which served as the ground truth for model training and evaluation.

Our work has been **submitted**, and we will detail the flow of the code in the future so that readers can replicate it.

Thank you for your interest in our work!
